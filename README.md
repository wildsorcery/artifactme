A Carbon Black Live Response artifact collection automation script, based totally on https://github.com/Jrotenberger/Powershell-IR-Scripts (I just made it easier to deploy via few commands (put 7za, put artifactme.bat, put investigation.zip, execfg artifactme.bat plus removed any executables not called by main powershell script to save space for initial upload) - at the end a file named: hostnameofthatmachine_artifacts.zip is created inside c:\windows\carbonblack\  ,ready for an easy extraction
All praise to Jrotenberger for making this script!
